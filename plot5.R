# Option 2
# as Herman Boudenoodt posted at https://class.coursera.org/exdata-010/forum/thread?thread_id=140#post-679
# based on NEI document at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2008inventory.html
# The NEI OnRoad and NonRoad data categories contain mobile sources which are estimated for the 2008 NEI v3 via 
# the MOVES2010b and NONROAD models, respectively. NONROAD was run within the National Mobile Inventory Model (NMIM). 
# Note that emissions data for aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels are NOT included in the NonRoad 
# data category starting with the 2008 NEI. Aircraft engine emissions occurring during Landing and Takeoff operations 
# and the Ground Support Equipment and Auxiliary Power Units associated with the aircraft are now included in the 
# point data category at individual airports in the 2008 NEI. Emissions from locomotives that occur at rail yards 
# are also included in the point data category. In-flight aircraft emissions, locomotive emissions outside of the 
# rail yards, and commercial marine vessel emissions (both underway and port emissions) are included in the NonPoint 
# data category.
